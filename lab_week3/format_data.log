You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see 
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

NOTE: Data file CHK.FAM2.DATA is in a format that is native to another host, or the file encoding does not match the session 
      encoding. Cross Environment Data Access will be used, which might require additional CPU resources and might reduce 
      performance.
