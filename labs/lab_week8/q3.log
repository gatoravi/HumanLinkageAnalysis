1 (of 1) markers to be included from [ q1.map ]
30 individuals read from [ q1.ped ] 
30 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
20 males, 10 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
Converting data to SNP-major format
20 founders and 10 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
Converting data to Individual-major format
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 20 males, 10 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
10 nuclear families, 0 founder singletons found
10 non-founders with 2 parents in 10 nuclear families
0 non-founders without 2 parents in 0 nuclear families
10 affected offspring trios
10 phenotypically discordant parent pairs found
0 Mendel errors detected in total
