1 (of 1) markers to be included from [ q4.map ]
20 individuals read from [ q4.ped ] 
20 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
10 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
20 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
Converting data to SNP-major format
0 founders and 20 non-founders found
1 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ q4.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
Converting data to Individual-major format
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
After filtering, 10 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 20 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
10 nuclear families, 0 founder singletons found
0 non-founders with 2 parents in 0 nuclear families
20 non-founders without 2 parents in 10 nuclear families
0 affected offspring trios
0 phenotypically discordant parent pairs found
0 Mendel errors detected in total
Writing DFAM results (asymptotic) to [ q4.dfam ]
