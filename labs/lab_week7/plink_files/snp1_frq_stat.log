Reading map (extended format) from [ hapmap1.bim ] 
83534 markers to be included from [ hapmap1.bim ]
Scan region on chromosome 1 from [ rs1891905 ] to [ rs1891905 ]
Reading pedigree information from [ hapmap1.fam ] 
89 individuals read from [ hapmap1.fam ] 
89 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ hapmap1.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Reading clusters from [ pop.phe ]
89 of 89 individuals assigned to 2 cluster(s)
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
