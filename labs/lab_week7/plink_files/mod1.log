Reading map (extended format) from [ hapmap1.bim ] 
83534 markers to be included from [ hapmap1.bim ]
Scan region on chromosome 2 from [ rs2222162 ] to [ rs2222162 ]
Reading pedigree information from [ hapmap1.fam ] 
89 individuals read from [ hapmap1.fam ] 
89 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ hapmap1.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
After filtering, 44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Full-model association tests, minimum genotype count: --cell 5
Writing full model association results to [ mod1.model ]
