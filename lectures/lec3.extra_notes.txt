Human Linkage and Association Analysis

Supplementary Notes, lecture 3

Using the LINKAGE program package for two-point (sometimes called single-point)
	linkage analysis (cf. http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/soft/linkage
	for additional documentation)

"LINKAGE" format for input data files

2 files: 
a pedigree file (.pre file)
a marker-information file

Pedigree file format:
for .pre files:
column:	   	
1:	pedigree/family id
2:	individual id
3:	individual's father
	(if the individual is a founder, put 0)
4: 	individual's mother
	(if the individual is a founder, put 0)
5:	gender
	(1=male, 2=female)
6:	phenotype
	(0=unknown, 1=unaffected, 2=affected)
7+:	genetic data (marker genotypes)
	(for this course, will use allele numbers to code genotypes:
	hence cols 7, 8: allele numbers for 1st marker)

example:
1  1  0     0      1     1     1 2     
1  2  0     0      2     1     2 2
1  5  1     2      2     1     1 2
1  6  1     2      1     2     1 2

Marker file format (a.k.a parameter file):
	(for two-point analysis of a single marker and the trait)

example:
 2 0 0 5  << NO. OF LOCI, RISK LOCUS, SEXLINKED (IF 1) PROGRAM
 0 0.0 0.0 0  << MUT LOCUS, MUT RATE, HAPLOTYPE FREQUENCIES (IF 1)
  1  2  << ORDER OF LOCI	  
1   2  << AFFECTION, NO. OF ALLELES
 0.990 0.010   << GENE FREQUENCIES
 1 << NO. OF LIABILITY CLASSES
 0.001 0.9900 0.9900 << PENETRANCES
3   5  << ALLELE NUMBERS, NO. OF ALLELES
 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 << GENE FREQUENCIES
 0 0  << SEX DIFFERENCE, INTERFERENCE (IF 1 OR 2)
 0.00000 << RECOMBINATION VALUES
 1 0.020000 0.20000 << REC VARIED, INCREMENT, FINISHING VALUE

Line:	Entry:
1:	1:	-number of loci (the disease phenotype counts as 1 locus)
	2:	-risk locus (=0 if no risk calculation; otherwise put 
			disease locus number
			(input order, usually 1) to calculate risk)
	3:	-sex linked (0=autosomal data; 1=sexlinked data)
	4:	-program type (1=CILINK, 2=CMAP, 3=ILINK, 4=LINKMAP
				5=MLINK, 6=LODSCORE, 7=CLODSCORE)
2:	1:	-mutation locus (0 if mutation rates are to be 0, o
			therwise locus number (input order))
	2:	-male mutation rate
	3:	-female mutation rate
	4:	-0 if loci assumed to be in linkage equilibrium, 1 loci assumed in 
			linkage disequilibrium
3:		-List loci in order desired (where loci are numbered in order
		of appearance below, which (if multiple loci are involved)
		should match the order the corresponding
		genotypes appear in the pedigree .pre file)
4:	1:	-Phenotype information 
		(1 = affected/unaffected)
	2:	-number of alleles 
5:		-allele frequencies for the trait locus (must sum to 1)
		note that allele order must be consistent with the penetrances given below
6:		-number of liability classes 
7:		-penetrances for the different disease genotypes, 
		in the order 11  12  22
		where 1 is the allele corresponding to the 1st allele freq on line 5
		and 2 is the allele corresponding to the 2nd allele freq on line 5
8:	1:	-code to specify how the marker alleles will be represented.
		code 3 = allele numbers (the usual representation)
	2:	-gives the number of alleles for the marker
9:		-gives the allele frequencies for the marker alleles
10:		-specifies if sex differences or interference will be assumed
11:		-recombination starting value
12:	1:	-code to specify if recomb fraction is to be varied (1 = yes, varied)
	2:	-increment 
	3:	-stopping value for recomb fraction

	is not read by the LINKAGE programs
